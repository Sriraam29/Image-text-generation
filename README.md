# Image and Text Generator Web Application

This project is a web application that allows users to interact with two AI models:
1. **Image-to-Text Generation**: Convert uploaded images into descriptive text.
2. **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate images based on a text prompt.

The web app is built using Flask for the backend, and it leverages the following machine learning models:
- **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)** for image-to-text generation.
- **Stable Diffusion** for text-to-image generation.

## Features
- Upload an image to generate a descriptive caption.
- Enter a text prompt to generate an image.
- View the generated image or caption in the browser.
- Download the generated image or caption.
